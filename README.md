Each of these files was created for my introductory C++ programming class at Bowling Green State University, CS 2010. Descriptions of each file are as follows:

Pgm1: This is a program used to help a movie theater calculate its gross sales, net profit, and how much should be paid to a movie's distributor.
Pgm2: This is a program that is designed to get user input for the number and type of Cedar Point passes and meal plans, calculate different costs and charges based on these inputs, and print a reciept for that customer.
Pgm3: This is a program designed to act as a simple cashier at an ice cream shop, taking orders, calculating change, and printing a receipt.
Pgm4: This program reads numerical data from a uder-determined file and creates a data summary, including a bar graph and a list of first, second, and third largest and smallest values, stopping when the value 9999 is reached. It takes special steps to correctly format and compute with negative values and large values.
Pgm5: The purpose of this program is to read data regarding US states' finanaces, then run calculations on it and return a neatly formatted list in addition to the average budget, the state with the highest budget, the state with the highest surplus, and the state with the lowest population.
Pgm6: This program reads data from two files and creates a summary in the terminal, as well as a different summary in a file named out.txt.
